# Data_Analysis
Data analytics applying linear regression, heuristic and metaheuristic methods.

A linear regression model was applied to a weather dataset, evaluating the possibility of predicting humidity by using wind speed and temperature variables. The final conclusions were compared with a recent study on the inverse proportion between wind speed and temperature against humidity.

Heuristic (Nearest Neighbor) and metaheuristic (Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing) algorithms were used to evaluate and minimize the cost to travel around world cities, with a focus on airplane travel. The efficiency of each algorithm was also analyzed in order to conclude which method was best suited for the problem.
